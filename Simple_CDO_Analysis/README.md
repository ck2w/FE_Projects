# Simplified CDO Analysis
FRE 6103 Valuation Mini-Project 2

Here we will simulate the payments of a CDO product, which consists of 10 correlated corporate bonds. We will simulate and research on the default rate and loss given default rate for each tranche. Given the simple analysis in this project, we will clearly see the reasons why the bank might have done this structure.
